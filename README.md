# Helpful Commands
Inside the easy-enroll directory, you can run several commands:

 - npm start
    Starts the development server.

 - npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

 - npm test
    Starts the test runner.

 - npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:
